# Car Parking Management System - Assembly Project
This project was made taking into consideration the issues that arise so frequently when searching for a parking spot in the city, especially if you have a bigger vehicle. With the continuously increasing number of vehicles, managing parking lots has become a lot harder and for drivers, looking for a place to leave their cars has come to be a challenge even greater.
